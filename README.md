# Threes-a-party

The point of this weeks challenge was to use jquery and third-party APIs to create cards for a task list, and then make them draggable and droppable into specified lanes.

# HTML

1. With the given starter code, create a modal in the HTML doc. 

# CSS

1. No css styling needed in the sheet. It was applied using bootstrap in HTML.

# JS

1. JQuery was used in this with third-party API's as the main focus. Reference the todo comments in the document to see what each individual section does.
